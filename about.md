This is intended as a sort of technical blog for things that I think others might find useful in the couse of doing devops-y things. 

My name is Tim Collins, I am a devops 'professional' with experience in a wide range of industries including Social Media, Insurance, Healthcare and Big Data Analytics.

I mostly throw yaml at computers to see what sticks. Sometimes I get lucky and something useful happens. I'll try and document the useful things here.
